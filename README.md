# Stroke-Prediction-End-to-End-ML-Project

## Problem Statement :
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.so we somehow already know then we can reduce the chances of Stroke by proper Treatment.

## Objective :
**Purpose of this Project to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status etc. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.** Throughout this Project i have followed the whole life cycle of a Data Science Project as: 
### EDA(Exploring Data and Understanding features doing univariate analysis,Bivariate analysis,Finding Distribution) and Data Cleaning(Finding Types of Features,Duplicate values,Missing Values,Outlier Detection)
### Feature Engineering((Imputting Missing Values,Outlier,handlingImbalanced)) and Feature Selection ,Feature Scaling
### Model Selection 
### Model Building 
### Model HyperParameter Tuning
### Model Evaluation(Testing)

## Tools and Technologies Used :
Python,Machine Learning,Sklearn,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy,Streamlit,Heroku.

## Data Collection :
I have gathered dataset from Kaggle for this project.

## EDA:
Perform eda on dataset to derive some conclusion and insights which could further in model building.

## Feature Engineering:
Impute Missing values,handle ouliers,removing duplicates values.

## Feature Selection :
Perform feature selection using correlation and tried to know which feature is impacting much to my target variable.

## Model selection :
used various machine learning algorithms(Logistic regression,Decision tree,Random forest,XGBoost) and tried to know which best suite on my dataset.

## Model Building: 
**here the main aim was somehow i wanted to reduce Type-2 error or False Negative so i have selected Decision Tree which was able to do it in my case.**

## Model Tuning :
perform hyperparameter tuning on Decision tree and achieved accuracy 93.2%.

## Model Tesing :
perform model testing on unseen data.

## Model Deployment:
save the model and loaded it Pycharm to delpoy it. for converting into web-app i have used streamlit and then deploy the model on heroku plateform.
